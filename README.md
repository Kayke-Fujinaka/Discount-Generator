> 🔎 Discount Generator 

## ⚔️ Challenge

In this challenge, you'll create an algorithm that generates unique discount codes and saves them to a JSON file. The application should have a front-end where the user can input the discount amount, expiration date, and number of codes to generate. The back-end should generate unique codes that haven't been used before and save them to a JSON file.
